Estoque Elementary School in Capungagan, Kapalong, Davao del Norte, Philippines, investigated the effectiveness of Spelling Games intervention in improving the spelling proficiency of Grade 6 students. The intervention was introduced in response to persistent spelling difficulties identified among the learners. The primary objectives of the research were to assess students' spelling proficiency levels before and after the implementation of the spelling games and to evaluate the overall impact of the intervention on their spelling skills. Furthermore, the study aimed to gather student feedback regarding their experiences with the spelling games and how these influenced their learning. A quantitative-descriptive research design was employed, complemented by qualitative insights through interviews, to provide a well-rounded analysis of the learners' spelling challenges and the effectiveness of the intervention. A total of 42 Grade 6 students participated in the pre-test, the spelling games sessions, and the post-test. Additionally, seven students were selected for in-depth interviews to offer more detailed perspectives. Results from the Barnell-Loft Diagnostic Achievement Test revealed that students initially demonstrated very low spelling proficiency across various components. However, post-intervention assessments showed a marked improvement, with participants achieving significantly higher scores in the same areas. Descriptive statistics revealed that the students’ mean score in the pre-test was 11.0 (SD = 5.82), while the post-test mean score increased significantly to 22.5 (SD = 2.40), indicating substantial improvement in spelling proficiency following the intervention. A paired sample t-test confirmed that this difference was statistically significant, t(41) = 18.3, p < 0.001, with a large effect size (Cohen’s d = 2.82), suggesting that the spelling games had a strong and meaningful impact on enhancing the students’ spelling skills. The findings underscored the positive impact of the spelling games, which not only enhanced students’ understanding and appreciation of spelling but also increased their motivation, engagement, and confidence. The intervention also fostered better spelling practice habits beyond the classroom and helped reduce students’ anxiety and fear of making mistakes." >

							<b>Abstract</b>
							<div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:500;">This study, conducted at Marcos P. Estoque Elementary School in Capungagan, Kapalong, Davao del Norte, Philippines, investigated the effectiveness of Spelling Games intervention in improving the spelling proficiency of Grade 6 students. The intervention was introduced in response to persistent spelling difficulties identified among the learners. The primary objectives of the research were to assess students' spelling proficiency levels before and after the implementation of the spelling games and to evaluate the overall impact of the intervention on their spelling skills. Furthermore, the study aimed to gather student feedback regarding their experiences with the spelling games and how these influenced their learning. A quantitative-descriptive research design was employed, complemented by qualitative insights through interviews, to provide a well-rounded analysis of the learners' spelling challenges and the effectiveness of the intervention. A total of 42 Grade 6 students participated in the pre-test, the spelling games sessions, and the post-test. Additionally, seven students were selected for in-depth interviews to offer more detailed perspectives. Results from the Barnell-Loft Diagnostic Achievement Test revealed that students initially demonstrated very low spelling proficiency across various components. However, post-intervention assessments showed a marked improvement, with participants achieving significantly higher scores in the same areas. Descriptive statistics revealed that the students’ mean score in the pre-test was 11.0 (SD = 5.82), while the post-test mean score increased significantly to 22.5 (SD = 2.40), indicating substantial improvement in spelling proficiency following the intervention.
